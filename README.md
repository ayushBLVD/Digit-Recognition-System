# Digit-Recognition-System
This project trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits, using a model with dense and flattened layers, and evaluates its performance on test data. Custom images are also predicted using the trained model. Libraries used - Tensorflow, Matplotlib, NumPy, OpenCV.
